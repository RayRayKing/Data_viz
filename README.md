Context of the data: The dataset is one of the historical sales of supermarket company which has recorded in 3 different branches for 3 months data. This is extremely generic data that provides transactional data from customers. I found the dataset from Kaggle.

I created 3 different views of the same data, all with a slightly different purpose.
  "Top Level Reporting" - A high-level view summary of all 3 branches combined. It breaks down to sales, customers profiles, and customer ratings. 
  "Product Line Performance" - Chart view of how the product lines are doing. It can be segmented into individual product lines and stores specifically through the drop-down menu on the top left. 
  " Customer Profile Analysis" - This is an analytical perspective breaking down how customers shop. It shows a breakdown of the types of purchases, preferred time and locations, and the overall stats per purchase.
